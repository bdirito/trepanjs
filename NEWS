release 0.2.1 2015-05-1
------------------------
  * Use --attach (replacings --pid) for attaching to an
  existing nodejs process in debug mode
  * Revise docs again. Add a rudimentary manual page for trepanjs
  * Add automated tests and start moving node debugger tests
    from node
  * show line count in info('files)
  * list warns when line listing is too large
  * revise package.json

release 0.2.0 2015-04-29
------------------------
  * set, show, and info commands are separate files. This means:
  - they have expanded help
  - are more uniform in parent command (set, show, info) handling
  As a result:
  - infoLine -> info('line), infoFiles -> info('files'), infoDisplay -> info('display')
    but note setBreakpoint is still around.

release 0.1.9 2015-04-29
------------------------
  * location indicatior file:line:num -> *file* at line line:num
  * add InfoLine

release 0.1.8 2015-04-28
------------------------

- Misc small listing things
  * line prefixes are -> and **.
  * prefix -> boldend if useColors.
  * print location on switching frames
  * add common list routine to simplify access to it
- store stop event, xx in -> call on frame switching


release 0.1.7 2015-04-27
------------------------

- add frame-changing commands 'up', 'down', 'frame'
  current position is noted in a backtrace; evaluation
  uses the scope of the current frame
- fix bug in listing breakpoint location
- eval? for an if/while expression truncates after closing ) properly
- add command-processing hack so that entering command a b is the same as a(b)
  for example "list 5" is massaged to "list(5)" and "help '*'" is massaged to "help('*')"
  but note you still need the quotes around strings, e.g. '*'.


release 0.1.6 2015-04-26
------------------------
- more help markup
- wrong github link


release 0.1.5 2015-04-26
------------------------
- syntax highlight source code lines
- show aliases in help
- see if port is in use before spawning listner
- add list('.') to reset to current source-code-line

release 0.1.4 2015-04-24
-------------------------
- help on commands is more complete and displays nicely
    using markdown formatting
- eval with no arguments runs current source line
- add "eval?" alias to extract command expression,
  For example, if source-code line is:
     if (x < 1) {
  eval() runs eval('x < 1')

release 0.1.3 2015-04-23
-------------------------
- fully qualify paths in backtrace
  this may be incorrect if debugging on another host
- version command shows trepanjs version
- columnize commands in help('*') listing
- other improvements in help command
- move debugger commands to directory lib/command

release 0.1.2 2015-04-22
-------------------------
- change in list command: when 'to' < 'from',  'to' is a line count
- Add ISC license
- version -> show-version

release 0.1.1 2015-04-22
------------------------

   * files split out from lib/_debugger.js, use nopt for options processing
   * unwatch/unisplay -> display/undisplay, see wiki on more detail here
   * list command works more like gdb's
   * trepanjs start script using nopt for option-processing
